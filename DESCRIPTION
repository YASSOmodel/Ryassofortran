Title: Provides functionality for calling the YASSO15 Fortran-release in R
Version: 0.4.0

Description: Provides convenient functions to call the Fortran90-release of the
    soil carbon model YASSO15 in R. The Fortran-release is up to two orders of 
    magnitude faster than the R-release. The absolute speed increase is not
    necessarily significant while simulating soil carbon, but for model 
    calibration purposes the Fortran-release is superior.
